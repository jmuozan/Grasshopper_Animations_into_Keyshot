# Grasshopper_Animations_into_Keyshot

----

## Import grasshopper animations to Keyshot as alembic files.

Still work in progress. Code based on the tutorial [How to export any Mesh or kangaroo animation directly from Grasshopper To Blender using Python](https://youtu.be/Xm__UO0vw8E?si=HCaIqv2emvJkY-vh). 

### Important note

As I mentioned before, this is a work in progress so the code is not pretty efficient. For sure there's better ways to do this without using Blender or having to do all the steps and for sure the code can be way more clean. I'm not a computer science guy, I'm an industrial designer with interest on coding and computational design. I also would appreciate it if you check my [website](https://jmuozan.github.io/jorgemunyozz.github.io/) or support me on my social media. 

### What do you need?

- Grasshopper plug-in for Rhino 3D (If you're checking this documentation probably you already know about it)
- Blender: An open source 3d software. You can download from [here](https://www.blender.org/). (I'm using version 4.0 on MacOS Sonoma)
- Keyshot: Rendering engine, I'm using version 11.0
